## Problem Statement  
### **Why This Project?**  
Healthcare providers collect vast amounts of patient and hospital data, but many hospitals lack the tools to efficiently analyze and interpret this data.  
This dashboard bridges the gap by turning raw data into actionable insights.

### **Business Objectives**  
- Optimize hospital operations by understanding admission and length-of-stay trends.  
- Increase revenue insights by analyzing billing data and insurance trends.  
- Improve patient care by identifying common medical conditions and test result trends.

## **Dashboard Structure & Insights**  
The dashboard consists of five main sections, each containing multiple tabs for detailed analysis.  

- Main Page: Summary & Trends
- Financial Insights 
- Demographics & Billing Analysis
- Test Results & Medical Conditions
- Admissions & Hospital Logistics
